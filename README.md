The initial step of this project will be to finish setting up customer sign-up
and log-in. Use the dummy restaurant id=1 to choose a restaurant for now.

Once the initial step is complete, add the log-in and sign-up for restaurants,
the customers will see all restaurants signed-up and restaurants will see all customers
reserved at their restaurant.

After this, customers will be able to delete their reservation and then add a new reservation
(one reservation at a time) and restaurants can also delete any of their customers reservation
(which changes the customers reservation to null).

(add more once the above are complete)
